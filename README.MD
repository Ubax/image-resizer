# Resizer

A simple node js script that can be used to resize many images at once

## Use

To run use `node index.js`

If you do not create `list.json` file this program will automatically read current directory for 
- jpg
- jpeg
- png
- gif

For now it resizes images to hardcoded sizes and places them in out directory.
